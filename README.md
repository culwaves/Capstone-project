# Capstone-project

Introduction!

Our project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to address predicting median house values for a given dataset. We aim to uncover patterns and establish predictive models that offer both accuracy and practical applicability.

We will follow 3 step process to address the problem.

Step 1:PRE-PROCESSING: Understanding the dataset


Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis and Feature Engineering


Step 3: Model Building

And Conclusion
